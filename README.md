# I310D - hcd-assignment1: Data Collection and curation
The goal of this project is to look at the national parks across the country (categorized by state) and the numbers of activities the parks held toward their tourists (also categorized by state). As well as getting to know the national parks more.

National Parks Data from: [*nps.gov*](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm#/)

All of the data are collected from National Parks Services website by Isabel Yang herself with API Key. This behavior got approved by the website.

This data is collected with the purpose of finding the relationship between the number of national parks in a state and the total numbers of activities the state's parks prepare and host for the tourists. This includes the actual parks numbers of each state, park location and the activities number of each park. 

The potentional problem is that the size of the national parks are different, that means not every national park would only locate in one state. There are parks that across mulitiple states which their location values are outside the standard deviation.
